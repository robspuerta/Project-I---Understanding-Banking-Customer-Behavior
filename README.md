Society grows and changes with time and this affects directly our consumer's behavior in unpredictable ways, even more with recent global events according to [Time magazine](https://time.com/5947302/covid-19-data/). It is essential to grow and change with our Clients, allocating our resources to what matters to them to keep competitive. 

### But how can we understand our customer's behaviors to make better decisions?

Regardless of the sector like Health, E-commerce, Financial, or other; gathering data about customers' interactions with our products and services is key for understanding what our Clients think and do. This way we'll be able to <u> make data-driven decisions and focus our strategy on what customers care about </u>, for example, more benefits, faster assistance, etc. 

Customer Relationship Manager (CRM) softwares like Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics are great to gather and store omnichannel customer interactions as long as we have set a good business process and technical structure for it.

A Practical Example with Banking Products
One way to set the structure in our CRM to collect data is by answering two questions: What are the stages of our products/services life cycle and How do they interact with our products in each instance. 

A Saving Account life cycle could be: Consideration, Acquisition, Product Uses, Claims, and Attrition; and Customer interactions with the Bank (or product) could go from #1what is a saving account and #5 how can I get it?" to more complex interactions like #4 transfers, #5 payments and, #14 withdrawals. All these actions can be identified, registered, and measured.

Now that we have collected data of 24 types of interactions from 5 different stages of our Customer Journey, we can analyze and make some educated guesses on the customer's behavior patterns.

Now that we have collected and processed all this as information, we can create new items on the #ProductBacklog so in the next #Sprint we can generate real value, changing and growing with our Clients, enhancing their experience.  

Let me know in the comments what sector are you in and if your organization is constantly getting feedback from your Clients and improving its experience by making data-driven decisions.   

This was an educational exercise, part of the Google - Data Analytics Certification focused on How to collect, clean, process, and present data. You can check the full data structure by interaction type and used channel on GitHub.
